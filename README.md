I chose this question because I myself have asked strangers if they would be willing to switch seats so that I can sit closer to my family. Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to see what other plane riders thought. Overall, I would say the chart reveals that most people don't think it's rude with the minority thinking it's very rude to ask someone to switch seats.
